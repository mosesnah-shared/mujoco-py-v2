# mujoco-py Version 2
A minimal (yet self-contained) MuJoCo Simulator to run a simulation.
This is called version 2, since it is based on [deepmind's mujoco](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco).

The mujoco viewer is separately downloaded from [here](https://github.com/rohanpsingh/mujoco-python-viewer)
